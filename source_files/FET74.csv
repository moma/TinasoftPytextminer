The proponents plan to take advantage of the novel possibilities made available by the distributed computing facilities including personal computers and cell phones to collect data by a number of sources.  Both sensors and human agents, providing empirical evidences and user-generated opinions, are involved in the project. Sensors of several relevant quantities, such as noise and air pollution, are now available for a relatively low cost, and can be distributed within an urban community to collect data. Thanks to current communication networks such data, along with user subjective opinions, can be transferred to server units to be processed and modeled according a number of methods recently developed by environmental scientists, information scientists, graph theorists and physicists.  The results of the data analysis, presented in real-time and through a number of user-friendly interfaces to users and institutions, could trigger a positive change in the behavior of individuals. This would raise the motivation in providing data and opinions, reinforcing in turn the data modeling activity.  Among the applications of such framework are the monitoring activity of the environmental condition citizens are exposed to, the optimization of the urban mobility, the self-organization of users towards a more efficient use of collective resources such as air, space and energy in the urban environment, the modeling of opinion spreading and shift in social communities.

CADMAD aims to make a foundational breakthrough in the way computers and computer-aided design and manufacturing is employed in DNA-based research and development, making a radically new use of information technologies in biology and biotechnology.Biology and biotechnology research involves “DNA programming”, which is akin to computer programming.  Researchers modify and combine DNA of interest in a programmatic way to uncover its function, to improve its function, or to create new functions.

CADMAD’s vision is to replace the labour-intensive DNA processing carried out today by tens of thousands of skilled wet-lab workers around the world, by high-throughput computer-aided design and manufacturing of DNA, which would be fundamentally more efficient than plain de novo DNA synthesis by effectively reusing existing DNA.  Computed-aided design and manufacturing of semiconductor chips has enabled the computer revolution, the Internet revolution, and the mobile phone revolution.

The silo-based education provided by most universities creates scientists expert in one discipline but ignorant of most others. Most PhD programmes require students to learn key ideas from other disciplines relevant to their topic, but knowledge across the community is patchy. This includes basic social science and even the core disciplines of mathematics, statistics, physics and ICT. The Complex Systems Society (CSS, 2000+ members) has identified this as a major hindrance to the development of the science.We will develop and use a remarkable new way of automatically creating educational resources. It is scalable so that the cost of educating large numbers of students is very low. It is adaptive to changes in the curriculum in fast-moving research fields creating new learning resources as new topics emerge, and it is adaptive to students by creating learning resource that reflects their personal styles of learning, background knowledge, and language. Étoile is a big step towards personalised learning.The basic étoile concept is simple but a demonstrator is needed to show that the idea works in practice for real students working towards masters and doctoral degrees. We will provide an open source implementation for use by the CSS, and other organisation needing to disseminate new ideas quickly at low cost to a heterogeneous community.Following proof of concept, the CSS will take étoile forward in its long term programme of professional training and recognition. Students with certificated mastery of the core curriculum will be highly attractive as post-docs. As mastery of the core curriculum becomes common communication in the research community will be much easier, there will be less duplication of effort and more cross-fertilization of ideas.

"FET","INSITE","INSITE","INSITE","The Innovation Society, Sustainability, and ICT. Our society is organized around a positive feedback dynamic that produces innovation cascades. In these cascades, new artifacts are inextricably linked with transformations in social organization and the generation of new “needs” for individual and society.  Besides desired effects, these cascades produce disruptive changes in the environment and in society itself, ultimately leading to sustainability crises. The usual, but inadequate, response to these is more innovation, unleashing new cascades, and new crises.  The core challenge in improving our responses is to link current, reductionist, models of past causalities with novel approaches to increase the number of dimensions in which phenomena are perceived, so that we may get better at anticipating the unanticipated consequences of innovation cascades. INSITE will pave the way for novel ICT approaches that will do so, since only through ICT can complex dynamics be “grasped” in sufficient detail to allow us to do the reverse of customary science: anticipate and complexify, rather than reduce and simplify.To further INSITE’s main objective to build a community dedicated to meeting the challenge described above, we will recruit people from a variety of fields to join us in working groups to (1) prepare case studies that illuminate the dynamics of innovation cascades involving ICT, from printing to the internet, (2) develop a roadmap indicating the kinds and uses of models to understand and guide these dynamics in the direction of sustainability, (3) devise experiments to elucidate innovation dynamics, in the context of multiplayer online computer games, (4) envision practices and technologies to enable networks of innovators to engage in experiments in “participatory policy”, and (5) explore the implications in theory and practice of reconceptualizing technology to include its social dimensions, leading to a notion of “generalized ICT” that includes such diverse things as cities, urban systems and museums.","Innovation Society, sustainability, innovation cascades, participatory policy, generalised ICT, model pragmatics, artifacts, agents, attributions"

High spectral efficiency is the holy grail of wireless networks due to the well-known scarcity of radio spectrum. The successive introduction of advanced communication techniques enabled by the massive increases in processing power over the last few decades has enabled a progressive rise in link spectral efficiency, which in emerging systems seems to be approaching its limits.It is becoming increasingly clear that major new improvements in spectral efficiency of wireless networks will have to entail addressing inter-cell interference. While up to recently there seemed to be no way out of the apparent end of the road in spectral efficiency growth, the emerging approach of Interference Alignment (IA)  – coming out of a very recent DARPA-funded project in the US – has cast new light in the spectral efficiency prospects of wireless networks: it promises new degrees of freedom that allow more parallel transmissions to take place within the same spectrum and free of interference from each other. The HIATUS proposal constitutes probably Europe’s first collaborative effort to explore the true potential of this approach in wireless networks, with the goal of making it a strong enabler for ultra-efficient wireless communications in Europe and beyond.

Future Internet is envisioned to evolve into a mega-structure with multiple heterogeneous devices interacting at multiple levels and time scales. In that sense, it inherently resembles a statistical mechanics disordered system in its complex structure, randomness of interactions at a microscopic level, and unpredictability of macroscopic outcome of these interactions. The space of possible configurations is high-dimensional and combinatorial and it is extremely challenging to understand network behavior and predict equilibrium states. Despite this, statistical mechanics techniques often provide strong quantitative predictions.STAMINA will exploit the structure of statistical physics techniques to build a systematic framework for energy efficient network control and optimization, consisting of computationally simple, distributed and principled algorithms that achieve optimal resource utilization even in regimes where other methods fail. Belief propagation based message passing techniques emanating from statistical physics theories made promising success stories recently in solving hard combinatorial optimization problems or in achieving landmark objectives in goals unattainable for decades, like the information theoretic capacity of the Gaussian channel through low-complexity iterative LDPC decoders.A novel powerful methodology will be put forward, where emerging behavior at a global system level is monitored and controlled through local measurements and actions taken at the atomic level of individual system constituents. The methodology will serve as enabler for novel network functionalities including prudent energy consumption mechanisms, self-managed coordination and adaptation to topology and load dynamics, on-line multi-scale resource allocation, decentralized content management, inference and decision making. Notable achievements of members of our multi-disciplinary team make us optimistic about the potential of the methods and motivate our research agenda.","Energy efficiency, Green networking, Statistical physics, Resource utilization, network inference, Message passing"

This project aims at the creation of robust and scalable quantum interfaces between different platforms for the implementation of Quantum Technologies. We will focus on interfacing interaction or measurement induced quantum resources in atomic matter to light fields, based on less demanding alternatives to cavity-enhanced interaction of light with single ultracold atoms. For some applications we even plan to use thermal atoms which allow for a further reduction in the experimental complexity. To this end we want to push the evolution of Quantum Technologies further towards technologically scalable quantum devices. We will realize quantum devices and interfaces based on Rydberg blockaded gases, quantum gases and room temperature gases in microfabricated structures as well as the full theoretical framework for their description. The new expertise emerging from our project will provide a platform for progress in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) towards real-world deployment of quantum repeaters for long-distance quantum communication.","Quantum Technologies; Quantum Interfaces; Scalable Quantum Devices;Rydberg Blockaded Gases; Quantum Gases; Optically Thick Samples"
"Batch_10","IQIT","IQIT","Integrated Quantum Information Technology","IQIT will develop and demonstrate novel routes towards scaling up physical devices for quantum information science (QIS) with particular attention to communication between different parts of a quantum processor by means of a quantum bus. Developing a scalable technology will be pursued by first advancing two successful solid-state and atom-optical devices, namely A) arrays of superconducting qubits coupled to microwave resonators – here all-optical quantum computing will be explored for the first time in the microwave regime – and B) highly controlled ion trap systems, and then by combining them to yield a scalable basis for universal quantum computation and processing of quantum information. This new, integrated scheme will be based on the simultaneous exploitation of superconducting qubits for fast and scalable computational tasks and of trapped ions for storage and processing of information with long coherence times. Integration between the solid-state and the atomic devices will be carried out building on extensive knowledge and experience of leading research groups in these two fields using, and on already existing experimental concepts and devices. Furthermore, in the development of the project, experiment and theory will closely collaborate at all stages, and importantly, a close collaboration between hitherto mostly separately developing subfields of quantum information science (solid state and atomic-molecular-optical physics) will be established allowing to combine the tremendous knowledge and expertise in both fields. The long-term vision out of which this project grows is an integrated scalable device for QIS. The breakthroughs envisioned in this project are, 1st  the design, realization, and test of an integrated device with superconducting gates and trapped ions register, and, based on the knowledge gained here and pointing further into the future, 2nd the design of a scalable integrated architecture.","Quantum Information Science, Integrated Technology, superconducting qubits, Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics, Trapped Ions."

Graphene, the most studied representative of the 2D graphitic materials, has overshadowed research on other potential 2D nanolattices with totally unexplored physical properties. One such 2D lattice, silicene (germanene), the Si (Ge) sp2-hybridized equivalent of graphene, if it exists, may offer better compatibility with silicon processing and may provide solutions for some of the problems of graphene associated with the lack of an energy gap. In this proposal we will focus on finding ways to induce and stabilize sp2 hybridization in Si and Ge and prove for the first time that silicene has a physical existence. This should be combined with similarly sp2-hybridized dielectrics which could offer a template for silicene and germanene growth and, at the same time, serve as gate insulators which are necessary for charge and current control in the 2D semiconductors. The ideal situation would be to obtain a sequence of sp2-hybridized dielectric/silicene alternating monolayers which are weakly bonded between each other in the vertical direction via van der Waals forces. A strong anisotropy could also be induced by regular sp3-hybridized ultrathin Si and Ge in which the periodicity along the vertical growth direction is artificially broken by the insertion of monolayer-thick non- semiconducting layers. In such a case, the bandstructure and the density of states could be strongly modified reducing in-plane effective mass while inhibiting the transport perpendicular to the layers. This could reduce gate leakage and carrier scattering, thus maintaining high mobility at low equivalent oxide thickness.","silicene, nanoelectronics, ultimate scaling, graphitic materials"
"Batch_10","DATA","DATA","Data Science for Simulating the Era of Electric Vehicles","Rising concerns over increasingly intolerable externalities of the car such as congestion, energy consumption, and the environmental implications have generated particular interest in how governments might develop integrated policies that would support the principles of sustainable development. A part of this sustainable solution may lie in the electrification of road transport. It is our objective to develop a novel integrated simulation environment using complex and highly detailed modeling, relying on a combination of innovative ideas and sophisticated technologies for agent-based simulation, high-performance data mining and social and complex network analyses. The goal is to take into account the interactions that will arise between mobility and the power distribution network as a result of the massive demand generated by the massive introduction of Electric Vehicles (EVs). Once the shift towards EV has become reality, it is important and thus an objective in this project to account for its related mobility and environmental consequences. The idea we propose, represents in our opinion a radical departure from the current state-of-the-art, since there is currently no analysis or simulation technology available to account for these highly interdisciplinary research domains. We believe a FET open project that is strongly driven by novel ICT research is absolutely necessary to accomplish this. The project we propose is putting forward a completely new way of thinking involving highly fundamental research that can only be achieved through a strong fundamental research collaboration and expertise which is needed to overcome the current limitations of agent-based simulations, based on the convergence of data mining and complex network analysis applied to a variety of mass-scale data about human time activity patterns. Once the fundamental research challenges are overcome, there are plenty of opportunities of use that go beyond the use of current simulation systems.","Agent-based simulation, data mining, network science, data, electrical vehicles, transportation, energy, environment"

During its lifetime, a digital object might go through several processing stages, including multiple analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) conversions, coding and decoding, transmission, editing (either aimed at enhancing the quality, creating new contents mixing pre-existing materials, or tampering with the content). The REWIND (REVerse engineering of audio- VIsual coNtent Data) project is aimed at synergistically combining principles of signal processing, machine learning and information theory to answer relevant questions on the past history of such objects. The REWIND proposal starts from the observation that each of these processing steps necessarily leaves a characteristic footprint, which can be potentially detected to trace back the past history of the available multimedia object in a blind fashion, i.e. without having access to the original content. Note that, in many cases, these processing steps introduce undesired and irreversible distortions (“misprints”) in the original multimedia object, e.g. due to insufficient sampling rate in the acquisition phase, coding artifacts in lossy compression, or imperfect error concealment strategies. Considerable efforts in multimedia processing research have been directed therefore towards a more comprehensive understanding of how to prevent these artifacts through, for instance, error-resilience mechanisms or techniques to avoid undesired or unauthorized modifications of the content streams.  REWIND intends to develop innovative tools and approaches to reverse this perspective completely: footprints are considered as an asset, i.e. a source of additional information about the multimedia object history, which can be leveraged to reconstruct the processing chain applied to the audio-video digital object.","Multimedia object; Reverse engineering on multimedia processing chain;  Multimedia processing chain footprint; Multimedia quality assessment; Multimedia forensics; Multimedia object fingerprint."

So far very limited progress has been made towards allowing computer-based applications to deal with laughter. This has to be contrasted with the fact that laughter is high on the list of emotion-related signs that one would like a machine to deal with.  ILHAIRE will lay the foundations of truly multimodal, multicultural laughter-enabled man-machine interaction, though the following measurable outcomes:  1.      A multicultural and multimodal database of laughter. This database will contain meta-data on the triggering conditions, and perceptual interpretation of it, annotated by psychologists.   2.       A classification of laughs depending on their types and meaning, as well as algorithms for the analysis of audio-visual laughter and classification based on its acoustic and visual features  3.     Generative models of laughter based on statistical parametric synthesis algorithms; parameters will include results obtained from the abovementioned classification step.    4.   A characterization of temporal features of laughter and of the synchronization relationship between multimodal signals (breathing and inhalation; motion of thorax, shoulder, etc)  5.      A test-case man-machine dialogue system capable of laughing in real interactive situations. We will study how and when to respond to human laughter, as in a contagion loop, and when to trigger machine laughter.   6.      An understanding of the impact of such a laugh-enabled machine on users (benefits: loosening up the atmosphere, avoiding frustration; drawbacks: fear of being laughed at; humiliation; malicious laugh)","Laughter analysis, laughter synthesis, laughter-enabled social interaction, laughing avatars"
